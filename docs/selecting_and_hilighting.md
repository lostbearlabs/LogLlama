## Filtering by Today's date

You can always filter lines by the current date with an explicit filter, for example `= 2019-08-17`.

To avoid modifying your script every day, use the commands `today` and `requireToday` instead.  These commands dynamically create a filter based on the current date.

By default, the format used is `MM.dd.YY`.  You can replace this with another format using the `dateFormat` command, for example `dateFormat YYYY-MM-dd`.
