## Tips and Tricks

* Most of the actions you can perform are listed in the application menu.  These include loading and saving script files, running the script, and changing the font size.
* All script commands are listed in the `Reference` pane.
* If you have some script text selected in the editor, then the menu command `Run` will run only the selected text instead of the entire script.  This makes it easy to interactively explore your log file.  
* During interactive exploration, the script command `clear` can be used to reset your output.
* During interactive exploration, the menu command `Undo` can be used to undo whatever line(s) of script you just ran.
* During interactive exploration, use the script command `==` to distil your display down to only hilighted lines and then the menu command `Undo` to revert.
* If a log line is annoyingly long, double click to display it in a resizable popup that wraps text.
